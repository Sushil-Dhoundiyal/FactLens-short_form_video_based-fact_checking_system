 If Jupiter was not in Brahmins, the Earth would have been finished by now. But how do we know? According to a calculation, there are around 1300 Earthly planets in Jupiter. And Jupiter is made of gas. You should know that Jupiter is called the Big Brother of the Earth. If the scientists believed that Jupiter was in the first state, and gradually it grew up and attracted the matters around it. As it was attracting the matter, its force-off attraction was increasing. That's why it became the biggest planet. Now the question arises how does it save the earth from being destroyed? Because Jupiter is a universe, its gravitational force is very much. Due to which it draws the things around it to its own. When big asteroids enter our solar system, before they reach the earth, they have to pass it to Jupiter. And Jupiter draws it from its high orbit. This is how the earth is saved.
